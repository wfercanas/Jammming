## Project Description
This web app lets you create playlists in your Spotify Account. This is enabled by allowing the user to search for songs in the Spotify Library and add them to an initial empty playlist ready to be created. When you decide all the songs you want for your new playlist are already selected, you can give your playlist a name and then save it to your Spotify Account.

## Project intention
This project is developed within the fullstack web development path of Codecademy and it's intention is to practice React while building a web app that also connects with the Web API of Spotify to access the account of the user to retrieve songs and create playlists.

## Protection of data and management of tokens.
To access your account in Spotify, you will be prompted to login in that platform. Given this, I do not get access to your credentials or personal data. Also, the web app uses an authorization flow that doesn't have permission to refresh or extend tokens when they expire, forcing the app to fetch the Spotify API for a new one.

## Technologies used
HTML5, CSS3, and React.

## Designs and Assets
